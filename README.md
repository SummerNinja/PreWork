Time spent: 13 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Video Walkthrough 
*****Disclosure*******
I do not have a Mac, so I developed on a library computer. However, due to policies, I cannot download software onto these computers,
so I cannot (or do not know how I could at this point) use LICEcap to create a video walkthrough :(
So instead, I took photos of different states of the app and compiled them to make a sort of walkthrough using my personal laptop. This
attempt is rendered below:

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Learning the conventions of Swift and XCode were challenging in building and expanding on the app.
Similarly, figuring out how to access the local region to get the currency symbol was difficult and resulted
in hours scouring the documentation and websites. However the solution ended up being quite simple, and in fact, I
almost stumbled upon it when testing out different things.

Besides the coding challenges, developing on a library Mac computer was more difficult than I anticipated especially 
because of the restrictions in dowloading software. Because of this, I could not download the github developer tools for
OS X or LICEcap, so it was challenging to figure out how to bypass these restrictions as best as I could to create and upload
the app. As a result, I was not able to create a .gitignore file until after I uploaded everything to github, so I am not sure whether the .gitignore took effect. I am currently searching about this issue online to find a solution in case it did not.
