* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Video Walkthrough 

***** I do not have a Mac and so am developing on my school's Mac lab computers, but I cannot download software onto the computers,
so I cannot (or do not know how I could at this point) use LICEcap to create a video walkthrough :(
So, instead, I snipped screenshots of the app and have typed annotations for each picture and have compiled them together to a webfile 
whose link is located below:


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
Learning the conventions of Swift and XCode were the biggest challenges in
building the app.
Additionally, figuring out how to access the local region to get the currency
symbol was difficult and the solution ended up being a much simpler solution that I stumbled upon
while testing out different things for a different optional extension.
